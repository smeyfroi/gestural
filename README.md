## User notes

Give it permission to run via the MacOS "Security" preference pane since it hasn't come from a trusted App Store.

There are two versions to choose from:
* `gestural-file`: click the box next to "Load video file" to use a `.mov` or `.mp4` file as the subject (else it shows a white screen and does nothing).
* `gestural-live`: give it permission to access your camera so it can use the live feed as subject

To use a custom palette, uncheck `Use video colours` and paste the URL for a palette from https://coolors.co/ into the `coolors.co URL` field.

Keys:
* `s` - save an image in the `gestural` folder in your home folder
* `g` - toggle the controls panel on/off
* `[` - save the controls
* `]` - load the saved controls
* `<space bar>` - pause everything so you can adjust controls
* `<tab key>` - pause video file but leave everything else running
* `.` - save a ghost of the current drawing to background
* `f` - fade the background
* '<shift key>` - stop the drawing from reacting to your mouse pointer

Note that saving an image will beachball the mac for a while: the files are large enough to make 36"x24" prints from. Watch out if you're tight on disk space: those images can be 100MB+. They end up in a folder called `gestural` in your home folder.
